> Tiny Javascript engine, does not support Typescript(yet).

```shell
code -> lexer -> [tokens] -> parser -> [NodeList] -> codegen -> [bytecodes] -> vm -> run
```

### Motivation

V8 is too bloated, and I don't understand C++ yet, I want to write a really lightweight Javascript engine.

And there is no real Typescript runtime yet, Maybe I can do it.
